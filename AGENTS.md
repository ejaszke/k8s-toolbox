# AGENTS.md

## Repository guidance for AI/code agents

1. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` before making changes.
2. Follow Conventional Commits for every commit.
3. Keep docs aligned: update `README.md` for usage changes and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for process rule changes.
4. Never commit secrets or private access material from `.kube` or `.ssh`.
